# CS330-Computer-Graphics-And-Visualizations
Sample of work from computer graphics and visualizations course

My work in this course has allowed me to develop my skills in working with opengl and identifying the causes of bugs in complex projects.

My design process involved starting with basic components and incrementally adding components as needed.

My tactics for fixing bugs, especially isolating potential problem areas, will surely come in handy in my future work.

Iteration was a huge factor in developing this 3d scene. It made the project manageable.
